# Python-Tkinter-RPG
In this tutorial series, we’re building a complete 2D open world RPG using Python’s Tkinter library and [TerraForge](https://github.com/BriannaLadson/TerraForge), a procedural generation library I created.

This is an evolving series based on a [game](https://youtu.be/IIxHbdJW5BU?si=7rWL2J-O9_9-SOWQ) I’m actively developing — inspired by Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode. I build a part of the game, then pause to teach exactly how I did it so you can follow along and create your own version. The series will grow over time as more systems are added.

The tutorial series is available in this repo's Wiki.
